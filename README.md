# Maliks-Linux-Roblox-Wrapper

This Roblox wrapper was designed for new and beginner Linux users to quickly get Roblox up and running as easy as possible.

### Setup ###

Download latest release from https://github.com/msmalik681/Maliks-Linux-Roblox-Wrapper/releases the file "Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" and make it executable from terminal in the same directory run "chmod +x Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh" in most modern distros you can just right click on the file select properties then permissions and check the box to allow executing as program.

Once the file is executable just run it. Open a terminal window then drag and drop the file in there then press return to run it or open a terminal in the same directory and run "./Maliks_Roblox_Wrapper.sh".

I highly recommend to first uninstall Roblox then install even if you have never used this wrapper before. There are options for graphics API I recommend OpenGL as Vulkan is a bit broken for now, avoid Direct X as it is not native to Linux.

### Roblox Studio ###

Studio can only be installed after Roblox is installed. Be sure to login to the Roblox app using quick login and the website then studio will work from the desktop shortcut only. If you having trouble with this you could try grapejuice.
